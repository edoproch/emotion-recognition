# Emotion recognition from biosignals: an analysis of state of the art techniques in EEG, ECG, GSR and speech
The repository contains a report done for the course "Affective Computing" during our Erasmus in Oulu.
In the report we summarised some state-of-the-art papers on the emotion recognition based on biosignals, three topics were covered:
* EEG Emotion Recognition using dynamical graph convolutional networks;
* Deepfake speech detection through emotion recognition;
* Emotion Recognition using EEG, ECG and face images;

Furthermore, in the last part of the report we discuss about a little research that we did. We used a dataset with some EEG signals to predict the emotion of the related subject. Our proposal use the spectogram of each EEG channel as input data.
